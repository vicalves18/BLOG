Easily create an image gallery on your posts, pages or any custom post type

== Description ==
This plugin allows you to easily create an image gallery on any post, page or custom post type. 
Images are can be added and previewed from the metabox. Images can be re-ordered by drag and drop.

About:  

There comes a time when you need more flexibility than the standard WP gallery offers, That’s when this plugin steps in.
This plugin’s goal is to make it easy to create a gallery and place it wherever you need.
A perfect example would be to create a product gallery for an ecommerce website and then 
have the flexibility to position it where you wanted to match your theme’s design.

Features:

1. Added the possibility to add two or more different galleries on one page
1. Drag and drop re-ordering
1. Add gallery to any post, page or custom post type
1. If more than one image is added to the gallery, the images become grouped in the lightbox so you can easily view the next one
1. CSS and JS are only loaded on pages where needed
1. Images link to larger versions (can be turned off)
1. Fully Localized (translation ready) with .mo and .po files
1. Add multiple images to the gallery at once

Use the shortcode or the function to show the gallery.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why my galleries don't show up after an update to Version 1.3 or above? =

In Version 1.3 of the plugin, we've added a major update. Now, you have the ability to add more than one galleries to your posts or pages.

For that reason, we have to introduce Gallery ID as an argument for the shortcode. E.g. you need to use [easy_image_gallery gallery="XXX"], where XXX is the ID of the gallery you want to display.

Each of your galleries in the edit screen of your page or post will generate a new shortcode which you'll be able to use in the page or post editor.

= Where are the plugin's settings? =

In your WordPress admin under Settings -> Media

= How can I use a different thumbnail size for each post type? =
